                <span>A Tribute</span> to Srinivasa Ramanujan born
                Srinivasa Ramanujan Aiyangar; 22 December 1887 – 26 April 1920)
                was an Indian mathematician who lived during the British Rule in
                India. Though he had almost no formal training in pure mathematics, he
                made substantial contributions to mathematical analysis, number
                theory, infinite series, and continued fractions, including solutions
                to mathematical problems then considered unsolvable. Ramanujan
                initially developed his own mathematical research in isolation:
                according to Hans Eysenck: "He tried to interest the leading
                professional mathematicians in his work, but failed for the most part.
                What he had to show them was too novel, too unfamiliar, and
                additionally presented in unusual ways; they could not be
                bothered". Seeking mathematicians who could better understand his
                work, in 1913 he began a postal partnership with the English
                mathematician G. H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, England.
                Recognizing Ramanujan's work as extraordinary, Hardy arranged for him
                to travel to Cambridge. In his notes, Hardy commented that Ramanujan
                had produced groundbreaking new theorems, including some that
                "defeated me completely; I had never seen anything in the least like
                them before", and some recently proven but highly advanced results.
                During his short life, Ramanujan independently compiled nearly 3,900
                results (mostly identities and equations).Many were completely novel;
                his original and highly unconventional results, such as the Ramanujan
                prime, the Ramanujan theta function, partition formulae and mock theta
                functions, have opened entire new areas of work and inspired a vast
                amount of further research. Nearly all his claims have now been
                proven correct.

                Ramanujan departed from Madras aboard the S.S. Nevasa on 17 March
                1914.  When he disembarked in London on 14 April, Neville was
                waiting for him with a car. Four days later, Neville took him to his
                house on Chesterton Road in Cambridge. Ramanujan immediately began his
                work with Littlewood and Hardy. After six weeks Ramanujan moved out of
                Neville's house and took up residence on Whewell's Court, a
                five-minute walk from Hardy's room.:202 Hardy and Littlewood began
                to look at Ramanujan's notebooks. Hardy had already received 120
                theorems from Ramanujan in the first two letters, but there were many
                more results and theorems in the notebooks. Hardy saw that some were
                wrong, others had already been discovered, and the rest were new
                breakthroughs. Ramanujan left a deep impression on Hardy and
                Littlewood. Littlewood commented, "I can believe that he's at least a
                Jacobi", while Hardy said he "can compare him only with Euler or
                Jacobi."Ramanujan spent nearly five years in Cambridge
                collaborating with Hardy and Littlewood, and published part of his
                findings there. Hardy and Ramanujan had highly contrasting
                personalities. Their collaboration was a clash of different cultures,
                beliefs, and working styles. In the previous few decades the
                foundations of mathematics had come into question and the need for
                mathematically rigorous proofs recognised. Hardy was an atheist and an
                apostle of proof and mathematical rigour, whereas Ramanujan was a
                deeply religious man who relied very strongly on his intuition and
                insights. Hardy tried his best to fill the gaps in Ramanujan's
                education and to mentor him in the need for formal proofs to support
                his results, without hindering his inspiration—a conflict that neither
                found easy. Ramanujan was plagued by health problems throughout his
                life. His health worsened in England; possibly he was also less
                resilient due to the difficulty of keeping to the strict dietary
                requirements of his religion there and because of wartime rationing in
                1914–18. He was diagnosed with tuberculosis and a severe vitamin
                deficiency, and confined to a sanatorium. In 1919 he returned to
                Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency, and in 1920 he died at the age of 32.
                After his death his brother Tirunarayanan compiled Ramanujan's
                remaining handwritten notes, consisting of formulae on singular
                moduli, hypergeometric series and continued fractions.
